# Unit 7

1. Use an if/then/elif/else construct that prints information about the current month. The script should print the number of days in this month, and give information about leap years if the current month is February.

       #!/bin/bash
       
3. Modify /etc/profile so that you get a special greeting message when you connect to your system as root

       echo "Willkommen ${USER}"

4. Edit the leaptest.sh script from Section 7.2.4 so that it requires one argument, the year. Test that exactly one argument is supplied.
